# React Seat Booking

This is a simple React application that allows users to book seats for a hypothetical event. The application displays a grid of seats and allows users to select seats by clicking on them. 

## Features

- Displays a grid of seats
- Allows users to select seats by clicking on them
- Prevents users from selecting seats that are already booked or that are adjacent to already booked seats
- Displays the number of selected seats and the total price of the booking

## Dependencies

To run this application, you will need to have Node.js and NPM installed on your system. You will also need to install the following dependencies:

- Bootstrap version 4.0.0: Used to style the application
- React DOM Router: Used to handle routing within the application
- Font Awesome SVG Core: Provides the core functionality for using Font Awesome icons
- Font Awesome Free Solid SVG Icons: Provides the solid icons used in the application
- Font Awesome React Component: Provides a simple way to use Font Awesome icons as React components

You can install these dependencies using the following commands:

```
npm install bootstrap@4.0.0
npm install react-router-dom
npm install @fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core
npm install @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons
npm install @fortawesome/react-fontawesome
```

## Customization

By default, this application does not include any backend functionality for storing and retrieving seat bookings. If you want to integrate the application with a backend service such as Firebase, MongoDB, or a SQL/NOSQL database, you will need to customize the code accordingly.

Here are some general steps you can follow to customize the application:

1. Choose a backend service and create an account if necessary.

2. Create a new project or database instance and configure the necessary authentication and security settings.

3. Update the `BookSeats` component in `src/components/BookSeats.js` to include code for communicating with your backend service. You will need to modify the `handleBooking` function to send a request to your backend service to store the selected seats and any other relevant information (e.g. user ID, event ID, payment information). You may also need to modify the `render` function to display any additional information or UI elements related to the booking process.

4. Update any other components or files as necessary to integrate with your backend service. For example, you may need to modify the `Seat` component in `src/components/Seat.js` to display the current booking status of each seat (e.g. booked, selected but not booked, available).

5. Test the application thoroughly to ensure that the booking process works as expected and that data is being stored and retrieved correctly.

Note that the specific steps and code changes required to integrate with a backend service will depend on the service you choose and the requirements of your application. Be sure to consult the documentation and resources provided by your chosen service for more information.
